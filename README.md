# Journal Core

Contains shared functions used by the [Journal](https://github.com/roblib/journal-project) distribution project.

This module doesn't do anything on its own, it provides classes and functions used by the Journal distribution.
Some plugins cause problems on site install if they are declared in modules that are part of a profile.
